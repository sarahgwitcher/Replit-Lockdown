# Replit-Lockdown
Removes elements of the Replit website which the candidate could use to access resources which should not be available to them during a school exam


Replit does not have controls for specific features within the site's interface. However, as Repl.it is a website, It is amenable to URL blacklisting and whitelistings to remove the ability to navigate away from the site to another webpage and access the help and community sections on the Replit website. Alongside the installation of the Replit Lockdown extension, which removes elements of the website which the candidate could use to access resources which should not be available to them during the exam, will allow the ChromeOS device to meet exam requirements.
